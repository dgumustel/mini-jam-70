# minijam70

These are files for a game entry for [Mini Jam #70](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-70-heaven). A game jam is an event where people race to make a game from scratch in a short amount of time, often 48 or 72 hours. The theme of this jam is "Heaven" and the limitation is that the player must be an inanimate object. 

Our entry, "Heaven's Little Helper" (title subject to change) is a 2D casual game where the player controls a smiling cloud that must catch people falling from the sky. When the players catches a person, they can deposit said person at the gate to Heaven and the player's score increases. If the players fails to catch a person, they fall into Hell at the bottom of the screen and the player's score decreases. This game is inspired by the 1980/1981 Game & Watch title 'Fire' where the player must use a trampoline to bounce people falling from a burning building to safety (our game is considerably less bouncy).
